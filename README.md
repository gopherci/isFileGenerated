# isFileGenerated

`isFileGenerated` checks if a file is generated. A file is generated if

- file contains a "// Code generated â€¦ DO NOT EDIT." line comment, as specified at https://golang.org/s/generatedcode, or
- path contains a directory named `vendor`, or
- path starts with a directory named `Godeps`, or
- path contains a directory named `testdata`.

Sets the exit status 0 if file is generated, 1 if not generated, or > 1 for other error.
